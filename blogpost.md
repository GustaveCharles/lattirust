### Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
Lattices provide a versatile foundation for a broad spectrum of quantum-secure cryptographic schemes. The additional structural properties inherent in lattice-based assumptions offer a significant advantage over other post-quantum assumptions, such as those based on collision-resistant hash functions. This added structure allows for the design of cryptographic protocols that exhibit greater efficiency in their implementation. The operations used in lattice-based cryptography (and especially in succinct and zero-knowledge proofs) are essentially linear algebra operations over a ring (or similarly parallelizable computations).

Given the critical importance of performance in the adoption and standardization of lattice-based cryptosystems, this project focuses on leveraging GPUs to accelerate advanced lattice-based cryptographic operations. Specifically, the project implements a GPU backend for the Lova lattice folding protocol to significantly improve computational efficiency. In this section, we will explore the rationale behind selecting GPUs for accelerating lattice-based proof systems and the benefits this brings to performance optimization and scalability.
